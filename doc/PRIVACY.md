# Privacy Statement

_Version 1.0, October 2018_

Your privacy is important to us. This statement lets you know the data we gather, how and for what purposes we use it. 

Elastacloud provide a range of products including low-level file format providers and high level analytical processes. This is a product specific statement regarding the parquet-dotnet project, which has two core components:

1) Parquet-dotnet: a provider for the Parquet file format for the .NET framework.
1) Parquet-CLI (Parq): a command-line tool that runs anywhere .NET Core runs, that uses Parquet-dotnet to provide first-class cross platform shell support for Parquet.

## Data We NEVER Collect

We never collect WHAT the content of a Parquet file created or loaded with our tooling is. The content of the files are your property and we respect your right of ownership on your property. We may ask for a sample of data should you raise an issue at [our Issue Tracker](https://github.com/elastacloud/parquet-dotnet/issues) and you may request to share this data sample privately. If you supply this data privately it will not be shared beyond the project team. You retain the right to decline the request for data, although this may negatively impact our ability to remedy any issues you encounter. 

We never collect information about WHO is using our tools, whether creating a parquet file, loading the file for inspection or any other process. We can never tell the identity of any operation performed with any of our tools.  

## Data We Collect

We gather information on the use of Parquet-CLI (Parq). We track the number of invocations of various functions. We use this information to guide investment, in that functions with low usage may receive lower priority for maintenance than functions with high usage.

We gather information on errors (exceptions) raised within Parquet-CLI (Parq) so that we can track error rates and proactively remedy issues. 

Data is gathered using Azure Application Insights using their standard tooling. This also gathers general information which is covered by [Microsofts' Privacy Terms](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement)
